# Appendisso

A plugin for [Wox](http://www.wox.one/) that appends your search to the end of a file.

## Use

As of now the file that is edited by the plugin is hardcoded, so you would need to compile it yourself and put the files on the Wox plugins folder.
In the folder you need only
plugin.js
Appendisso.dll
Images/

## Why

There are to-do applications that allow you to easily input tasks into the app. This plugin was thought to be used with plain-text todo files, like a todo.txt.
